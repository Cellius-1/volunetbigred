# Volunet

Volunteering is a tedious yet required task for the young generation. Being both beneficial to the one willing to help, and providing assistance to the organization requesting their aid, acts of community service help all parties involved. However, volunteering is not easily accessible to most. Many participants are unaware of all the opportunities near them, especially those that pique their interests. Due to this, we decided to create VoluNet.

VoluNet is a platform which aimes to make volunteering and community service easily accessible to everyone. Through VoluNet, aspiring volunteers can search for opportunities near them. Recruiting non-profit organizations and services can post applications, with registration easily accessible. These establishments may include certain keywords when posting, such as "library", "sports", "hospital", etc., allowing volunteers to find them easily when scrolling through their feed. When volunteers browse for these opportunities, they will see the location, date, time, prerequisites (if any), and a description of the service. Once users find a suitable opportunity, they can read its description and plan to attend on the date(s) listed.
